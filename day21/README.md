I have actually be coding almost every day, even though I haven't been making commits. My most recent project is an Alexa app called "Igbo Trivia."
I use the NodeJS "Reindeer Game" template found here:

It is almost done. Unfortunately, there is a bug that does not increment the score when the answer is correct. Your score remains at 0.

I'm uploading the index.js and the question.js files. If you want to see what the rest of the source code go to the above link. I did not change any ohter files.
