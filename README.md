# 100-Igbo-Website
Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days

<b>October 7, 2018:</b> <a href="https://github.com/neurogirl47/100-Igbo-Website/tree/88e2c71b6404a16e87a89a02ddfa333e33cb8a5d/dayone">Day One </a> - <u>Home Page of 100 Igbo Websites</u> (Introduction)

Note:I literally worked on Day One for under 2 hours. I did not spend a lot of time, because I got the idea to do this one at around 8PM on a Sunday and decided to get started. Let's hope Day Two and beyond will look much better!

<b>October 8, 2018:</b> <a href="https://github.com/neurogirl47/100-Igbo-Website/tree/master/daytwo">Day Two </a> - <u>Wakandize Your Name app </u> On the second day of this project, I tried to create a web app using javascript that adds "T'Ch" to the beginning of your name when you submit your name using a form. It does not seem to be working. 

As short and simple as this code looks, despite the fact that I couldn't get it to work, I spent several hours (5+) of non-stop coding trying to make it work. I told my self that I would begin wrapping up close to midnight. It is now 11:56pm.
