<div class="container"><h1>Hi! My name is Udochi and I am making 100 Igbo websites</h1>
	<br>

<p>This is a project that combines two of my passions: Igbo & Coding!
<img class="udochi" src="./images/udochi-profile.jpg" />
<br>My goal is to build 100 websites incorporating Igbo language, symbols and culture in some way. This idea comes from a project by Jennifer Dewalt. A woman who built 180 websites in 180 as she attempted to master coding.

<br> You can see a video of her project below</p>

<p> You can view my github repository with all my code below. This site will change over time. So, to see the code as it was on the day it was erected, please visit the following GitHub links:</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>I literally worked on Day One for under 2 hours. I did not spend a lot of time, because I got the idea to do this one at around 8PM on a Sunday and decided to get started. Let's hope Day Two and beyond will look <i>much</i> better!
