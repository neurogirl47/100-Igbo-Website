On the second day of this project, I tried to create a web app using javascript that adds "T'Ch" to the beginning of your name when you submit your name using a form. It does not seem to be working.

As short and simple as this code looks, despite the fact that I couldn't get it to work, I spent several hours (5+) of non-stop coding trying to make it work. I told my self that I would begin wrapping up close to midnight. It is now 11:56pm.
