Spent today trying to fix the "Wakandize" website. Finally got it to work albeit not the way I wanted it to. I ended up using document.write() funtion to get the words on the screen.
The most important part is that you see your name with "T'Ch" at the beginning and using the Wakandized font.

It is currently 7:20 pm and I am going to try edit the home page to look more appealing.
