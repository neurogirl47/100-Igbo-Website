# IGBO Live Blogger

I have got to build a blogging function in here. So, I don't have to hardcode edit this page all the time. Today, I created my own font out of Igbo characters and I used it to create an Igbo text editor that allows you to type Igbo characters in your browser. It changes the font from your keystrokes. When I used it, I realized that it is EXTREMELY counterintuitive, and actually frustrating because I changed ALL the keys on the keyboard. So, you constantly have to think about what you are typing. I think how I will fix this is by only changing the keys on the special characters. So, A-Z will be the same except "C X and Q" which are the only characters we do not use in Igbo. Then, I will replace those along with 0-9 with the 13 Igbo special characters. Tomorrow (or just some other day), I will work on adding a custom "right-click" menu for the site that will allow people to add tones. I'm really excited about this one! :)
